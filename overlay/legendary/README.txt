👑 LEGENDARY ITEMS FOLDER
================================================================================

Place your RARE / LEGENDARY items in this folder!

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. Any .png file in this folder is automatically treated as LEGENDARY.
2. Legendary items have a configurable drop chance (Default: 1 in 1000).
3. They trigger special effects and give more points (5 pts).

EXAMPLES:
---------
File: GoldenSword.png       → Chat shows: "looted a LEGENDARY Golden Sword!"
File: Excalibur.png         → Chat shows: "looted a LEGENDARY Excalibur!"

NOTE:
-----
You do NOT need to add "Legendary-" to the filename anymore if you put them here.
Just name them normally (e.g., "Excalibur.png").
