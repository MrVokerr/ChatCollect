🎨 DYNAMIC LOOT SYSTEM - INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

The bot now AUTOMATICALLY detects ALL .png files in this folder!

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. Add ANY .png file to this overlay/ folder
2. The bot will randomly select from available PNG files as loot
3. The filename becomes the display name in chat
4. You can add or remove PNGs anytime - no code changes needed!

EXAMPLES:
---------
File: sword.png             → Chat shows: "looted a Sword!"
File: potion.png            → Chat shows: "looted a Potion!"
File: ancient_relic.png     → Chat shows: "looted an Ancient Relic!"
File: golden_crown.png      → Chat shows: "looted a Golden Crown!"

NAMING TIPS:
------------
- Use underscores (_) or hyphens (-) for spaces
- Use lowercase with capital first letters for best readability
- Keep names descriptive but not too long

SPECIFICATIONS:
---------------
- Recommended size: 64x64 or 96x96 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- No limit on number of items!

CUSTOM APP ICON:
----------------
To give the ChatCollect.exe a custom icon:
1. Create an .ico file (you can convert a PNG to ICO online).
2. Name it "exe_icon.ico".
3. Place it in the main folder (where the .exe is).
4. Run "build_exe.bat" again.

START BY:
---------
Delete this .txt file and add your first PNG image (e.g., sword.png)
Then add as many more as you want - the bot handles the rest!

IMPORTANT:
----------
Make sure you have at least ONE .png file in this folder before running the bot.
If no PNGs are found, the bot will use a fallback list but won't work correctly.
